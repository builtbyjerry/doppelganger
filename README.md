# Facial Recognition Demo Frontend

This repository contains a **frontend prototype** I contributed to as part of a small team (with backend and frontend engineers).  
It was originally developed to **test and visualize the performance of a facial recognition system** being built at the time.

I have moved **my personal copy** of the frontend here to my official GitHub profile **strictly for portfolio and demonstrative purposes**.  
**Full ownership remains with the original company and team â€” this is *not* a redistribution of the backend or private data.**

### ðŸ”§ What This Frontend Does

- Splash screen & login flow  
- Success / result screen (face match result)  
- Compare Screen â†’ input two photos and get similarity score  
- Live camera feed capture page for facial testing  
- Designed purely to **show backend API responses visually**

> Note: The backend/API is **not included here** â€” I may later connect this to a mock server or public face recognition playground for demo purposes.

### ðŸ§© My Contribution

I was involved across the core user journey â€” from the splash/login flow all the way to the image comparison and final result experience.

Specifically contributed to:
- âœ… Result / Success Screen
- âœ… Compare Screen (image input & similarity output)
- âœ… Assisted in early flow screens (splash / authentication)
